🧠 Multi-Agent AI for Smarter Requirement Gathering

📌 Problem Statement

Requirement gathering is often **time-consuming, error-prone, and highly manual**, relying heavily on discussions between stakeholders, analysts, and developers. Misunderstandings, missing details, and ambiguous requirements frequently lead to **rework, scope creep, and unclear product goals**.

🚀 Solution Overview

This project introduces a **Multi-Agent AI system** designed to make requirement gathering **faster, clearer, and more reliable**.
Instead of relying on a single AI or manual analysis, multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to:

* Capture user requirements
* Detect ambiguities and inconsistencies
* Suggest refinements and clarifications
* Validate requirements against business goals

By distributing responsibilities across agents, the system reduces **human bias**, improves **clarity**, and enhances **project success rates**.

🧩 Key Features

* 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture** – Specialized agents with distinct roles
* 📝 **Automated Requirement Capture** – Converts user input into structured requirements
* 🔍 **Ambiguity Detection** – Identifies unclear or conflicting requirements
* ✨ **Refinement Suggestions** – Improves quality and completeness of requirements
* 📊 **Business Alignment Check** – Ensures requirements align with project objectives
* ⚡ **Faster & Adaptive Process** – Reduces manual effort and rework

🏗️ System Architecture (Conceptual)

| Agent                       | Responsibility                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Requirement Collector Agent | Gathers raw user inputs                    |
| Analysis Agent              | Identifies gaps and ambiguities            |
| Refinement Agent            | Suggests clearer and improved requirements |
| Validation Agent            | Aligns requirements with business goals    |

All agents collaborate to produce **high-quality, actionable requirements**.

🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **AI / LLM-based Agents**
* **Multi-Agent Coordination Logic**
* **GitHub** for version control

*(Extendable to frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, etc.)*
