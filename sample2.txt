Project Brief: ConnectSphere - The Future of Internal Communications
Document Version: 1.0
Date: September 21, 2025

1. Vision & Goals
Our current internal communication is fragmented across emails, chat clients, and outdated intranet pages. This leads to information silos and a disconnected workforce, especially with the rise of remote work.

ConnectSphere will be a centralized, modern, and engaging platform designed to revolutionize how our employees connect, communicate, and collaborate. The primary goal is to foster a stronger sense of community, improve information discovery, and boost overall employee engagement.

2. Core Features (Phase 1)
The initial launch should focus on the following key modules:

User Profiles: Every employee will have a rich profile. This must include their name, job title, department, office location, and contact information. Users should also be able to add a profile picture, a short bio, and list their key skills and current projects. Profile data should be searchable.

Company News Feed: A central, dynamic feed where the company can post official announcements, news, and updates. This will replace company-wide emails. Posts should support text, images, and links. Employees must be able to "like" and comment on posts.

Events Calendar: A shared company calendar for all official events, such as town halls, training sessions, and holidays. Users should be able to view event details and add events to their personal work calendars (e.g., Outlook, Google Calendar).

Direct Messaging: A simple, one-to-one chat feature allowing any employee to securely message any other employee. We need to ensure conversations are private. Group chat is not required for Phase 1.

3. User Stories
As a new employee, I want to easily find and learn about my colleagues by searching for their name or skills, so I can feel more integrated into the team.

As a project manager, I want to see which projects my team members are currently working on by looking at their profiles.

As any employee, I want to stay informed about important company news without having to dig through my email inbox.

As a remote employee, I want to know about company-wide virtual events so I can participate and feel connected.

4. Technical & Design Considerations
The platform must be mobile-friendly and accessible via a web browser on both desktop and mobile devices. A native mobile app is a future goal, not part of Phase 1.

Security: Integration with our existing Single Sign-On (SSO) system is mandatory for authentication.

Feel: The user interface should feel modern, clean, and intuitive. It should not feel like a legacy enterprise tool. We need it to be engaging.

5. Out of Scope for Phase 1
Department-specific groups or communities.

Video conferencing capabilities.

Advanced analytics dashboard for engagement metrics.

Integration with third-party project management tools.
